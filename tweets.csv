     .  has started the conversation about how we avoid the next pandemic which is important. I appreciate your work on this. We can do a lot better next time!!
    A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year.   tracks the genetics really well. We may have to take yearly shots for Covid for some time.
    As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.

    The data is pretty strong that it came from another species which is true for most pandemics. People will continue to speculate on this and we should make sure labs are careful. There will be future outbreaks coming from other species so we need to invest in being ready.

"    I am optimistic about polio eradication - we are close. Malaria, HIV, Nutrition, will take a lot longer but better tools are coming. Education also needs innovation - it is behind where global health is particularly for girls."
    From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals. The pandemic is a huge setback - including rich countries not focusing on the needs of developing countries as much. I hope we can reverse that.

"  Also some countries did a better job of reducing mobility, using masks and protecting the elderly.

We weren't prepared - no practice in advance."
  A few countries like Australia moved fast to diagnose cases at scale and isolate people who were infected. They were able to limit deaths dramatically. Once the numbers get large in a country it is too late. So the first few months made a lot of difference.

 When we have adequate supply then tiered pricing is used where the rich countries pay a lot more than middle income and low income pay the least which is funded by . When supply is limited rich countries have to not outbid the others so governments are key to this. 
 mRna vaccines still can't meet all the demand so figuring out who gets what is complicated.
 During 2021 the supply of vaccines was limited and they mostly went to wealthy countries. Now we have a lot of supply overall and the problems are logistics and demand. The health systems in developing countries are a limiting factor.
" The vaccines we have prevent severe disease and death very well but they are missing two key things.

First they still allow infections (""breakthrough"") and the duration appears to be limited.

We need vaccines that prevent re-infection and have many years of duration."

Through my foundation work I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to talk to‚Äîand learn from‚Äîexperts in many different fields. Many of my conversations recently have been about the omicron variant and how to prevent the next pandemic. 
Understanding how the connections in our brains give rise to consciousness and our ability to learn may help lead to great breakthroughs in the way we solve the world‚Äôs hardest problems. This is one of the most fascinating books I read this year.

One of my favorite holiday traditions is sharing books with family and friends. Here are 5 books I loved reading this year: 
Mamello Makhele is a hero from Lesotho who traveled by foot and donkey to bring health services to women in need during the pandemic. Her story is nothing short of inspiring:  
"I know it‚Äôs frustrating to go into another holiday season with COVID looming over us. But it won‚Äôt be like this forever. Someday the pandemic will end, and the better we look after each other, the sooner that time will come."
"If there‚Äôs good news here, it‚Äôs that omicron moves so quickly that once it becomes dominant in a country, the wave there should last less than 3 months. Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022."
"There will be more breakthrough cases in people who are vx‚Äôd, which sounds concerning but is purely a factor of how many people are vx‚Äôd and how fast this variant is spreading. Vaccines are designed to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying &amp; are doing that well."
"In the meantime, we all have to look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable, whether they live down the street or in another country. That means wearing masks, avoiding big indoor gatherings, and getting vaccinated. Getting a booster gives the best protection."
"The big unknown is how sick omicron makes you. We need to take it seriously until we know more about it. Even if it‚Äôs only half as severe as delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because it‚Äôs so infectious."
Omicron is spreading faster than any virus in history. It will soon be in every country in the world.
"Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic. Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and I‚Äôve canceled most of my holiday plans."
"In Tanzania, health workers and community members are serving as disease detectives with a new app called Afyadata:  "

"Great to meet with  again to recognize Niger‚Äôs progress in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. His commitment to this fight, to polio eradication and to disease elimination at large will help save millions of lives. "
This order signed by President Biden signals a strong commitment to deploying the solutions we need to get to net-zero and avoid a climate disaster.  
"2021 was an incredibly hard year for many people, including me, but there are reasons to be optimistic that 2022 will be better:  "
"Better nutrition can lead to shifts in health and productivity‚Äîboosting prosperity for families, communities, and economies. At the N4G2021 in Tokyo, I announced our support for ‚Äôs nutrition fund to ensure tools to combat malnutrition are available to those in need. "
"2021 has been a year of big transitions for me, but it hasn‚Äôt changed why I love the work I do. Here are four things I‚Äôm thinking about heading into next year. "
"The groundbreaking RTS,S vaccine will help save tens of thousands of children and is paving the way for a new pipeline of tools to EndMalaria. "
"Robots will play a huge part in our future, and fiction like Kazuo Ishiguro's Klara and the Sun is a great way to explore what that might mean. "
Accelerating long-duration energy storage innovation can significantly reduce annual CO2 emissions and lay the foundation for a net-zero economy by 2050. 
The  is supporting GIISER which is working to increase the in-country capacity for rapid evaluation of variants on the African continent. This will help us better understand variants of concern and how the current vaccines may perform. 
"South Africa did the right thing by reporting these cases. They have invested heavily in R&amp;D including genomic sequencing capabilities which have made it possible to quickly identify variants, like Omicron, and help the world respond appropriately."
Experts like Trevor Bedford have done an excellent job explaining what scientists have learned so far about the new variant of concern known as Omicron. 
I made this video a few months ago to help explain what happens when a virus mutates. You can read more about the ways in which new variants are (and aren‚Äôt) complicating the pandemic here:  
"I usually read a lot of non-fiction books, but lately I‚Äôve found myself drawn back to the kinds of novels I would‚Äôve loved as a kid. These were some of my favorites this year: 

Which do you like better?"
"There‚Äôs lots of speculation about what Shakespeare‚Äôs life was really like, but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart. "
"When I was a kid, I was obsessed with science fiction. But ‚Äôs latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren‚Äôt a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend. "
